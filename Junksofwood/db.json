      "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sums up Canada best:\n\"From dogsledding in the Northwest Territories to surfing in Tofino, from the history of Old Quebec to the vibrancy of multicultural Toronto, from breathtakingly empty prairie skies to the warm welcome on George St in St John's, from the thrill of skiing in the Rockies to the serenity of paddling past a moose in Algonquin Park-there's nowhere else on earth that offers the range of adventures that await you in Canada.\"\nHome of hockey and Tim Hortons, 2017 marks the 150th anniversary of Canada's Confederation, making it 150 years we've been on the \"eh\" team.\nThese brooches are laser cut from oak plywood, about 2 inches in height. They have hand painted details and are finished with a varnish sealant with a silver c clasp brooch pin. Due to the handmade nature of this item, each piece will be slightly different from another.\nAll pieces are designed and produced by myself at my home studio in St. John's, Newfoundland.",

This place is home to the oldest settlement and the oldest city in North America, but is the youngest province of Canada. A vast land, with a relatively small population, Newfoundland and Labrador has some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.\"\nIt's a place that those who call home love fiercely, and a place that visitors wish they could call home. No matter if you're a Livyer or a CFA (Come From Away), with this Newfoundland map brooch showcasing the capital St Johns, you can take a little piece of home with you wherever you go.\nThese brooches are laser cut from meranti plywood, about 2 inches in height. They have hand painted details and are finished with a varnish sealant with a silver c clasp brooch pin. Due to the handmade nature of this item, each piece will be slightly different from another.\nAll pieces are designed and produced by myself at my home studio in St. John's, Newfoundland.",

This place is home to the oldest settlement and the oldest city in North America, but is the youngest province of Canada. A vast land, with a relatively small population, Newfoundland and Labrador has some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.\"\nIt's a place that those who call home love fiercely, and a place that visitors wish they could call home. No matter if you're a Livyer or a CFA (Come From Away), with this Newfoundland map brooch showcasing the capital St Johns, you can take a little piece of home with you wherever you go.\nThese earrings are laser cut from maple plywood, about an inch and a half in height, hand painted, and finished with a varnish sealant. The posts and backs are silver plated and nickel free. Due to the handmade nature of this item, each piece will be slightly different from another.\nAll pieces are designed and produced by myself at my home studio in St. John's, Newfoundland.",

With over 22 species of whale visiting our coasts between May and September, these majestic beasts frolick and play in our waters, creating a spectacle for us to enjoy. \nFrom minke whales to blue whales and even orca, Newfoundland is also home to the world's largest population of humpbacks. The humpback fluke is a common sight on our shores, and is represented here in this earring!\nThese earrings are laser cut from maple plywood, about an inch in height, and finished with a varnish sealant. The posts and backs are silver plated and nickel free. Due to the handmade nature of this item, each piece will be slightly different from another.\nAll pieces are designed and produced by myself at my home studio in St. John's, Newfoundland.",
